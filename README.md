<h1> PyPong </h1>

<h3> The classic pong game made on Python </h3>

<p> I tried to recreate the classic video game Pong that was made by Atari in 1972 using Python  .
The game launches in Single Player mode by default which means that the Paddle on the right side ( Paddle B) is controlled by the computer.
To play in multiplayer mode, comment out lines 130-134 </p> 


<h3> Controls and running the game. </h3>
> Clone the repository and open the file pong.py in Visual Studio Code <br>
> Use "W" and "S" to move the Left Paddle ( Paddle A ) <br>
> Use "Up" and "Down" to move the Right Paddle ( Paddle B ) [ Use only after commenting out lines 130-134 ] <br>

<h4> Have Fun ! :)) </h4>
